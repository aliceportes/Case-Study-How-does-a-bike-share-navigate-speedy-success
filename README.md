# Cyclistic: Case Study
This case study is part of the Google Data Analytics course.


## Overview
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-sharing company based in Chicago. Financial analysts at Cyclistic have determined that annual members are significantly more profitable than casual riders. As a result, the marketing analytics team has established a clear objective: develop marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

To achieve this goal, it is essential to gain a deeper understanding of how these two rider groups differ in their usage patterns.

This capstone project provides an opportunity to apply the skills we've developed throughout the program, including: **data cleaning, analysis, and visualization**  to answer the company's central business question and support data-driven decision-making.
