# Cyclistic: Case Study
This case study is part of the Google Data Analytics course.


## Overview
Cyclistic is a fictional bike-sharing company based in Chicago. Financial analysts at Cyclistic have determined that annual members are significantly more profitable than casual riders. As a result, the marketing analytics team has established a clear objective: develop marketing strategies to convert casual riders into annual members.

To achieve this goal, it is essential to gain a deeper understanding of how these two rider groups differ in their usage patterns.
