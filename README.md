# Cyclistic: Case Study
This project was developed as part of the capstone for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate.


## Overview
This case study analyzes how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic’s bike-sharing service differently. The goal is to provide insights and recommendations to help convert more casual riders into annual members.

## Data Analysis Process Phases:

**1. Ask: Define the problem and confirm stakeholder expectations**

**2. Prepare: Collect and store data for analysis**

**3. Process: Clean and transform data to ensure integrity**

**4. Analyze: Use data analysis tools to draw conclusions**

**5. Share: Interpret and communicate results to others to make data-driven decisions**

**6. Act: Put your insights to work in order to solve the original problem**

## Tools Used
- SQL
- R 
- Tableau
- Power Point

## Process
1. **Data Cleaning** – Removed nulls, standardized formats
